Genesis has been gaining popularity over the years, you must have seen it atleast once on the roads. Genesis is the luxury version of hyundai in simple words. It has many great and good priced cars such as the GV90, GV80 and the GV70 and so on. Genesis is founded by the owner of Hyundai (Chung Ju-yung). This particualr car company has made many improvements over the year from being the car that people hate to the car that people prefer nowdays. They have reliable engines and technology they will never fail on you when you need it the most. Most of you know what cars im talking about when it comes to bad reliability (Mercedes, Bmw, Bentely and the other fancy companies). The company released its first car in 2003 as a luxury concept vechile then it started gaining a lot of populartiy.
</P>The founder of Hyundai motor group.
